Patch ISO build of appliance by applying a patch.

TKLPatch is a set of shell scripts which provide a simple way to customize and
extend any appliance in the TurnKey Linux virtual appliance library. It's
designed in the Unix tradition as a modular collection of simple sub-scripts.

This is the top high level script, which calls:

    1) tklpatch-extract-iso         
       Disassemble the ISO to extract its contents

        1) cdroot: ISO filesystem - contains bootloader and compressed rootfs
        2) rootfs: uncompressed root filesystem

    2) tklpatch-apply               
       Apply the patch to the root filesystem. 

       Patch structure:

         patch-dir/
             debs/       # custom debian packages (installed with dpkg -i *.deb)
             overlay/    # overlay applied to root filesystem
             conf        # configuration script to execute in chroot (rootfs)

    3) tklpatch-prepare-cdroot      
       Prepare cdroot for ISO creation. This mainly compresses the extracted
       root filesystem.

    4) tklpatch-geniso
       Generate an ISO from the cdroot.

Environment variables:

    TKLPATCH_DEBUG       

      Turn on debugging: this makes tklpatch more verbose and prevents
      deletion of temporary directories.

Example usage:

    TKLPATCH_DEBUG=y tklpatch path/to/turnkey-core.iso mypatch/

    exit 1

if ! [ -f $isofile ]; then

cdroot=$name.cdroot

tklpatch-geniso $cdroot

# delete temporary rootfs and cdroot unless TKLCONV_DEBUG
[ -z "$TKLPATCH_DEBUG" ] && rm -rf $rootfs
[ -z "$TKLPATCH_DEBUG" ] && rm -rf $cdroot
